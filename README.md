# Eclat with Negation for Association Rule Mining

A Python implementation of the Eclat algorithm extended to discover frequent itemsets containing negated items. This project explores the impact of negative literals on the quantity and quality of generated association rules.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to implement the Eclat algorithm from scratch and extend it to support negated literals (e.g., "if product A was _not_ purchased..."). The project evaluates various association measures (support, confidence, lift, etc.) to compare the rules generated by the classic Eclat and the extended version.

## Features

- Pure Python implementation of the classic Eclat algorithm.
- Extension to handle negated items in itemsets.
- Calculation of multiple association rule quality metrics: support, confidence, lift, conviction, Jaccard, and more.
- Analysis performed on the popular Retail Market Basket Dataset.

## Dataset

This project uses the **Retail Market Basket Dataset** from the FIMI Repository.

- **Transactions:** 88,162
- **Unique Items:** 16,470
- **Source:** [http://fimi.uantwerpen.be/data/](http://fimi.uantwerpen.be/data/)

## Installation

This project uses Mamba for environment management.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/twoja-nazwa-uzytkownika/eclat-negation-mining.git
    cd eclat-negation-mining
    ```

2.  **Create and activate the environment:**
    The `environment.yml` file contains all the necessary dependencies.
    ```bash
    mamba env create -f environment.yml
    mamba activate med_project
    ```

## Usage

The main analysis is conducted in the Jupyter Notebook located in the `notebooks/` directory.

1.  Activate the conda environment:
    ```bash
    mamba activate med_project
    ```
2.  Start JupyterLab:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
3.  Open and run the notebooks in the following order:
    - `notebooks/01-EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis.
    - `notebooks/02-Experiments.ipynb`: Algorithm execution and rule evaluation.

## Methodology

The core of the project is the `Eclat` class located in `src/eclat.py`. The algorithm first builds TID-lists (sets of transaction IDs) for frequent individual items. For negated items, a TID-list is the complement of the positive item's TID-list. The algorithm then recursively intersects these TID-lists to find frequent itemsets.
